# Advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture

This example demonstrates an advanced multi-agent orchestration architecture where a router agent decomposes complex requests and routes them to specialist agents.

## How to Run

1.  **Start the server:**

    Open a terminal in the `advanced-orchestration` directory and run the following command:

    ```bash
    python servers/agent.py
    ```

2.  **Run the client:**

    Open a second terminal in the `advanced-orchestration` directory and run the client:

    ```bash
    python clients/stream.py
    ```
