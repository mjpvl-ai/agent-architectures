# Single Agent Architecture

This example demonstrates a basic single-agent architecture where a client connects directly to a single agent.

## How to Run

1.  **Start the server:**

    Open a terminal in the `single-agent` directory and run the following command:

    ```bash
    python servers/agent.py
    ```

2.  **Run the client:**

    Open a second terminal in the `single-agent` directory and run the client:

    ```bash
    python clients/client.py
    ```
